# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide is a condensation of everything learned in the Prework of the Coding Bootcamp taught in Tec de Monterrey. This Guide is includes some basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. 

The purpose of this guide is to learn and execute at the same time the commands, languages, tricks and statements related to each of the four topics. This guide reflects whats was learned in the Prework and how it translates to each student.  Within this Study Guide it was possible for me to see tangible results of the exercises implemented in GitHub and in VS code. To achieve this guide it was necessary several attempts to modify and translate code from VS code to gitHub, adding some notes and personal changes to the original format of the Guide.
